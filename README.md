# This repository is a learning space where I revisit and refractor earlier JavaScript projects using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The goal is to deepen my understanding of classes, encapsulation, modularity, and clean code architecture by transforming procedural code into well-structured, object-oriented code.

## What's inside:

✅ Refactored versions of past small-to-medium sized projects;

✅ Emphasis on reusable class-based structures;

✅ Practice with separation of concerns (e.g., UI logic, game logic, state);

✅ Use of constructors, method encapsulation, and interaction between objects;

## Purpose:

This repo serves both as a coding journal and a hands-on exercise in applying core OOP concepts in JavaScript. It's about improving readability, maintainability, and scalability while reinforcing good software design habits.
